      <h1>Welcome to Daily Vocabulary Builder</h1>

      <p>
        I'm Quentin, the creator of this app, and I want to share my story with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an immigrant to the United States, I've always been eager to improve my vocabulary. Learning a new language and adapting to a new country can be challenging, and having a strong vocabulary is crucial for communication and success.
      </p>

      <p>
        I developed Daily Vocabulary Builder because I couldn't find a simple and effective way to increase my vocabulary. I wanted something that would fit seamlessly into my daily life, without making the process feel like a chore.
      </p>

      <p>
